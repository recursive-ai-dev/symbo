# Military-Grade NanoTensor Quick Start

## What Makes It Military-Grade?

The enhanced NanoTensor is designed to be **copy-pasted into agents to give them agency** - the ability to autonomously perceive, reason, learn, and act. It's like giving your agent a brain that:

🧠 **Learns from every operation** - Builds experience and adapts behavior
💪 **Monitors its own health** - Self-aware of performance and reliability  
🛡️ **Validates all inputs** - Security-first with bounds checking
🔧 **Recovers autonomously** - Graceful error handling and self-repair
📊 **Tracks everything** - Comprehensive metrics and diagnostics
⚡ **Optimizes itself** - Intelligent caching and auto-optimization

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/recursive-ai-dev/symbo
cd symbo

# Install it (only sympy/numpy/networkx are required - no extra dependencies)
pip install -e .

# The military-grade behaviour is built into the shipped NanoTensor class
# (symbo/nanotensor.py) - there is nothing else to enable.
```

> **Which class?** `from symbo import NanoTensor` is the production class and has
> the agency layer (health monitoring, validation, experience tracking, caching).
> `symbo/nano_tensor_enhanced.py` additionally offers `MilitaryGradeNanoTensor`, a
> *standalone* copy of the same design for runtimes that cannot install the package;
> it is not a subclass and exposes a smaller API. Use `NanoTensor` normally.

### 30-Second Example

```python
from symbo import NanoTensor  # the shipped, hardened class
import sympy as sp

# Create a military-grade brain
brain = NanoTensor((1,), max_order=2, base_vars=['x', 'y'])

# Set up security bounds (military-grade validation)
brain.set_validation_bounds('x', -10, 10)
brain.set_validation_bounds('y', -10, 10)

# Create a policy function
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
brain.data[0] = x**2 + 2*x*y + y**2

# The brain automatically learns from every operation
brain.diff(x)                          # Learns about differentiation
brain.eval_numeric({'x': 1, 'y': 2})  # Learns about evaluation

# Check what it learned (agency status)
status = brain.get_agency_status()
print(f"Experiences: {status['experiences_recorded']}")
print(f"Health: {status['health']}")
print(f"Recommendations: {status['recommendations']}")

# Get comprehensive health diagnostics
health = brain.health_check()
print(f"Success Rate: {health['metrics']['success_rate']:.2%}")
```

### Run the Demo

```bash
# See all military-grade features in action
python demo_military_grade.py
```

This shows:
1. Health monitoring system
2. Learning & memory system
3. Security & validation layer
4. Autonomous error recovery
5. Intelligent caching system
6. Agent with NanoTensor brain
7. Intelligent recommendations

## Copy-Paste Agent Template

Here's a complete agent you can copy-paste and customize:

```python
import sympy as sp
from symbo import NanoTensor

class AutonomousAgent:
    """
    Agent with a military-grade NanoTensor brain.
    Copy-paste this and customize for your needs.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, state_vars, action_vars):
        # Create the brain
        self.brain = NanoTensor(
            (len(action_vars),),
            max_order=2,
            base_vars=state_vars
        )
        
        # Set security bounds (customize these!)
        for var in state_vars:
            self.brain.set_validation_bounds(var, -100.0, 100.0)
        
        # TODO: Set up your policy function here
        # self.brain.data[0] = your_policy_expression
    
    def perceive(self, state):
        """
        Perceive environment (automatically validated).
        Returns: action array
        """
        return self.brain.eval_numeric(state)
    
    def decide(self, state):
        """
        Make autonomous decision with health-aware behavior.
        """
        health = self.brain.health_check()
        
        # If brain is healthy, proceed normally
        if health['status'] in ['optimal', 'good']:
            return self.perceive(state)
        
        # If degraded, trigger self-optimization
        self.brain._attempt_self_optimization()
        return self.perceive(state)
    
    def get_diagnostics(self):
        """Get full diagnostic report."""
        return {
            'health': self.brain.health_check(),
            'agency': self.brain.get_agency_status()
        }

# Use it!
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    state_vars=['position', 'velocity'],
    action_vars=['force']
)

# Agent automatically learns and adapts as it operates
for t in range(100):
    state = {'position': t * 0.1, 'velocity': 1.0}
    action = agent.decide(state)
    
    # Check status periodically
    if t % 20 == 0:
        diag = agent.get_diagnostics()
        print(f"Health: {diag['health']['status']}, "
              f"Experiences: {diag['agency']['experiences_recorded']}")
```

## Key Features

### 1. Health Monitoring
```python
health = brain.health_check()
# Returns: status, success_rate, cache_hit_rate, avg_time, etc.
```

### 2. Agency & Learning
```python
status = brain.get_agency_status()
# Returns: experiences_recorded, patterns_learned, recommendations
```

### 3. Security Validation
```python
brain.set_validation_bounds('x', -10, 10)
# Automatically validates all inputs
```

### 4. Enhanced Operations
All operations are automatically enhanced:
- `brain.diff(x)` - Tracks performance, attempts recovery
- `brain.eval_numeric(state)` - Validates inputs, detects anomalies
- `brain.simplify()` - Monitors complexity
- `brain.diff_cached(var)` - Intelligent caching

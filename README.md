Symbo is a hybrid symbolic–numeric reasoning system built from the ground up by
deconstructing **318 classical algorithms** across algebra, optimization, dynamics,
and computational geometry.

Instead of adopting any algorithm wholesale, each was **reduced to its atomic
computational components**, de-parented from its original context, and evaluated
for suitability within a **generative symbolic algebra architecture**. These
primitives were then recombined into a unified framework capable of:

- generating Taylor-manifold policy functions,
- evaluating symbolic tensors with exact semantics,
- performing Gröbner-based constraint solving with streaming output,
- conducting second-order perturbation analysis,
- producing neural-assisted approximate solutions,
- running pathfinding over symbolic energy landscapes to perform reasoning,
- and enabling browser-side inference through WASM.

The result is not a clone of existing tools, nor a traditional CAS, nor a neural network.
It is a **new model class**: a nano-scale symbolic generative engine that can be trained,
fitted, perturbed, serialized, visualized, and reasoned over — all while maintaining
mathematical interpretability.

Symbo provides:

- A true n-dimensional symbolic tensor type
- A generative Taylor-expansion core 
- A multi-method coefficient solver (Gröbner bases, perturbation theory, least squares)  
- Arrow/MessagePack serialization for high-speed I/O  
- WASM-friendly execution for browser runtimes  
- Manifold-based reasoning via A* pathfinding
- Explainability through derivative trees and variable influence mapping

This repository contains the full implementation, usage examples, demos, and
a high-level description of the architecture derived from the algorithmic decomposition
process.
